      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
	Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to
	Mars is 4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because
	of orbital dynamics. Up to now, communications have been done on
	a layer-2 point-to-point basis, with sometimes the use of
	relays, but no layer-3 networking has been in use. <xref
	target="RFC4838"/> reports an assessment done around 25 years
	ago concluding that the IP protocol stack was not suitable for
	deep space networking. This result led to the definition of a
	completely new protocol stack based on a store-and-forward
	paradigm implemented in the Bundle Protocol(BP) <xref
	target="RFC9171"/> and its various components, such as
	convergence-layer adapters (<xref target="RFC9174"/>, <xref
	target="RFC7122"/>) and BP Security (BPSEC) <xref
	target="RFC9172"/>.
      </t>
      <t>More recently, space agencies plan to deploy IP
      networks on celestial bodies, such as the Moon <xref
      target="ioag"/> or Mars<xref target="ioag-mars"/>, on the
      surface and in orbital vicinity, using layer 2 technologies such
      as Wi-Fi or 5G. On the surface, the plan is to have a dense
      network around facilities and habitats.</t>
      <t>Mission concepts are also based on a cluster of multiple network nodes nearby at Lagrange points.</t>
      <t>
	A previous document <xref
	target="I-D.many-deepspace-ip-assessment"/> revisited the
	initial assessment of not using IP and concluded that the IP
	stack is viable in deep space, given the IP stack evolution
	that happened since the original evaluation. This document
	defines an architecture to use IP in deep space networking. IP
	in deep space means running IP over deep space layer-2 links,
	a reliable transport over IP, applications protocols over that
	transport, and applying proper routing, security, and network
	management on that IP network. Reusing the whole IP stack in
	deep space enables the reuse of all protocols, tools, and
	software currently used on the Internet. However, as one might
	already argue, many components of the IP stack cannot be used
	as is and therefore requires careful configuration and
	deployment considerations that are discussed in this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN), also known as Delay and
	Disruption-Tolerant Networking, has been used to identify the
	problem space, and since the solution was based on the Bundle
	protocol, DTN has also been associated with the Bundle
	protocol. This document tries to solve the DTN problem using
	the Internet Protocol stack. Therefore, in this document, the
	DTN keyword is used to name the problem space, not the Bundle
	protocol solution.
      </t>
      <t>
	Since the Moon is a few light seconds away from Earth, it is
	possible to configure and run various IP-based protocols and
	applications to make it "work". Mars with a much longer delay
	is more difficult. Therefore, this document uses Mars as the
	base example, knowing that if it works for Mars, a much harder
	problem, it could be replicated easily for the Moon or other
	networks made with relays around a celestial body. This
	framework would also work for longer delays, such as reaching
	Jupiter or the whole Solar System Internet (SSI), but it is
	not specifically discussed. This document uses "deep space"
	extensively as opposed to "space" which often includes
	earth-orbiting communications, which are not covered in this
	document. Even if the definition of deep space per the ITU
	does not include the Moon, this document applies to IP
	networks on the Moon.
      </t>
      <t>It should also be noted that DTN and BP were also designed
      for non-space use cases. While this document focuses on the deep
      space use case, it shall work for the other use cases of BP, but
      these use cases are outside of the scope of this document.</t>
      <t>Space missions are typically planned for many years and are
      long-lived, spanning years or even decades. Spacecraft are
      controlled from Earth and therefore should always be manageable
      from Earth. Given the remoteness and the difficulty of physically accessing the spacecraft software upgrades and configuration changes are avoided whenever possible.</t>
      <t>As with the Bundle protocol, this framework proposes to use
      IP in deep space with a similar store-and-forward
      paradigm. Therefore, the IP layer has to deal with the fact that
      a destination may not be currently reachable and that IP packets
      could be stored for an unusual amount of time, such as minutes,
      hours, or days, in the forwarding device waiting for a new
      link-up  opportunity. The transport layer should be able to work
      with long and variable delays, including intermittent
      communications. The application protocols and the applications
      themselves should be properly set to wait a longer time than on
      the current Internet to receive a response to a query. Finally, all network services such as routing, security, naming, and network management should also be adapted to this new context. This document is structured around these layers.</t>

      <name>Use Cases</name>
      <t>Multiple countries are developing systems for a sustained
      lunar presence combining manned and robotic missions, within
      several years.  IP has been included in the stack for the
      International Deep Space Interoperability Standards <xref
      target="idsis"/>, and the LunaNet Interoperability Specification
      <xref target="lnis"/>.  There is a general intention to extend
      and reuse systems developed for lunar use for later use on Mars.
      </t>
      <t>Separate space agencies and private companies are deploying
      lunar space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats,
      crewed mission elements, and other assets.  Due to the pervasive
      use and support of IP in modern computing systems, IP is
      naturally used onboard many space systems, and between
      co-located systems. As more and more IP-enabled assets become
      deployed in the lunar vicinity, the opportunities to
      interconnect them will increase.  Internetworking of lunar (and
      future Mars) systems is becoming essential, as plans call
      explicitly for cooperation between mission elements and
      communications/navigation system assets operated by different
      space agencies and private companies acting as service
      providers.  There are expected to be several different lunar
      network service providers (LNSPs) offering different varieties
      of relayed and direct services.  We should expect that lunar IP networks should over time become united into larger aggregates, and even into a single interoperable network (as intended with the LunaNet concept).</t>
      <t>
	Routing within and between dynamically connected network
	elements may be handled in various ways, as the practices
	develop and specific systems are deployed.  Conventional
	routing approaches are possibly applicable. There will likely
	be coordination between LNSPs and some methods to share and
	control pre-determined time-varying static routes like a
	PCE-based architecture, traffic volume expectations, security
	policies, etc.  The early steps in lunar networking may not
	immediately interconnect the Internet directly with the lunar
	surface, though later on this may become reasonable.
      </t>
      <section anchor="examplenetwork">
        <name>Exemplary Network</name>
        <t>The example network for this document has deep space links
        using IP over CCSDS space links <xref
        target="IPoverCCSDSSpaceLinks"/> and a connected IP network
        will be established with local network infrastructure and
        services on and around a celestial body. Orbiters around the
        celestial body provide connectivity to and from Earth to the
        devices on the celestial body. For example, a rover on the
        Mars surface might be connected to a Mars surface IP network
        which receives intermittent connectivity from a few orbiters
        with an average of 6 hours per orbit. Some of those orbiters
        have circular orbits, others elliptical. The latter means that
        the overpasses are not at a fixed frequency. The orbiters are
        connected to Earth-based ground stations while in line of
        sight with Earth. Earth and Mars have a variable signal
        propagation delay from 4 to 20 minutes. That one-way delay
        however changes slowly as the planets are orbiting around the
        Sun.</t>
        <t>When an orbiter has a direct line of sight with Earth, it can
	receive from and transmit packets to Earth. During that
	window, it may also have connectivity to other devices in
	orbit or on the surface, but very often it does
	not. Therefore, during those periods where only part of the path is up, the orbiter must buffer the received packets until the next segment becomes available when it forwards the packets and flushes the buffer.</t>

        <name>Current situation on Mars</name>
        <t>While the target scenarios for the Moon or Mars are far more complex than what is deployed today, it is useful to know what has been deployed already. This section describes the Mars communications infrastructure as it relates to its layer 2.</t>
        <t>On Mars, there are a few devices such as rovers and
        helicopters that are in use. There are currently 5 active
        orbiters that provide communications relay services between
        Mars surface and Earth. On Earth, various antennas such as the
        Deep Space Network (DSN) <xref target="DSN"/> are used to
        communicate with Mars. The MAROS project at the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory is a software broker enabling missions to enter
        data about communications capabilities such as frequency,
        bandwidth, and windows of communication time so that rover
        missions can schedule their communications. Most orbiters,
        such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) <xref
        target="mro"/>, are scheduled using MAROS. MRO was launched in
        2005 and has a single 40Mhz processor and over 100GB of
        solid-state memory. One might expect communications windows to
        have a constant frequency, however, the reality is that they
        are highly variable resulting in a very inconsistent
        round-trip time (RTT) <xref target="marscommstudy"/>.  For
        example, within 3 months in 2024, the RTT varied from 30
        minutes to 170 hours.</t>

    <section anchor="ip">
      <name>Internet Protocol</name>
      <t>IPv4 or IPv6 packets can be carried as is over long delays
      and disruptions, as IP has no notion of time. Originally,
      the Time To Live (TTL) field of IPv4 was defined based on time
      <xref target="STD5"/>, but it has been effectively implemented
      as a hop count, which was renamed as "Hop Count" in IPv6 <xref target="STD86"/>. Nothing needs to be changed to the IP protocol or its packet format.</t>
      <section>
        <name>IP Forwarding and Store-and-Forward</name>
        <t>
	  For deep space applications, an IP packet may need to be
	  stored temporarily over much longer periods than are typical
	  for the Internet when the next hop is currently unreachable
	  or undefined, which can happen due to orbital dynamics. This
	  is commonly referred to as "store-and-forward" and bears no
	  relationship to the same term when used regarding
	  switch architectures.
	</t>
        <t>
	  This store and forward mechanism may be implemented at layer
	  2 as is currently done by the Mars orbiters. In this case,
	  the frames are stored, regardless of payload type.  In this
	  case, IP packets are unaware of the store-and-forward and no
	  changes are needed in the IP forwarding function.  The L2
	  network is just behaving as a point-to-point link with a
	  large and variable latency.
	</t>
        <t>
	  If an IP forwarder has an interface on an intermittent link, and that link is down,
      some destinations may become unreachable when there is no alternate route. In this case,
	  the forwarder store the packets locally instead of dropping them. This might be implemented as a deep queue with
	  active queue management (AQM) <xref target="RFC7567"/>. When the
	  route to the destination is back, on the same link or a different link, maybe minutes or hours
	  later, the stored packets can be transmitted.
	</t>
        <t>
	  This store-and-forward mechanism requires proper
	  provisioning of storage for the
	  target deployment and usage. If the storage is full, then
      packets must be dropped. The choice of which packets
	  to drop depends on the policies configured on the node, which may be a
	  function of traffic class, source or destination IP
	  addresses, flow labels, or other parameters. An example is
	  described in <xref target="I-D.blanchet-tvr-forwarding"/>.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="headercompression">
        <name>Header Compression</name>
        <t>
	  Deep space links are point-to-point links and bandwidth in
	  space is very valuable, so header compression is very effective. Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-schc-architecture"/> is a header
	  compression technique that relies on rules in a static
	  context and is, therefore, more efficient for deep
	  space. SCHC should be considered on a deep space
	  point-to-point link or a string of L2 links.

      <name>IP Routing</name>
      <t>
	Existing routing protocols require proof of
	liveness between protocol partners, implemented through
	the periodic exchange of packets between partners. This is
	impractical on long-delay or intermittent links, so a PCE
	<xref target="RFC4655"/> based approach seems appropriate for
	those domains possibly supplemented by contact plan schedules
	<xref target="I-D.blanchet-tvr-contactplan"/> <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang"/>. Interconnection between
	domains can still be done with BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>,
	but long-delay or intermittent links should be
	avoided. Domains straddling such links must provide
	proxy advertisements for prefixes reachable across such links.
      </t>
      <t>
	Optimal routing for domains with intermittent links is out of
	scope for this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	On the surface of celestial bodies and in proximal orbit,
	traditional protocols are applicable and should be used (e.g.,
	<xref target="I-D.li-arch-sat"/>).
      </t>
      <section title="Addressing">
	<t>
	  The IP address space is a hierarchical namespace where
	  ranges of addresses are encoded as "prefixes".  Individual
	  domains advertise prefixes to the broader Internet
	  and assign these addresses internally. Prefixes may be
	  aggregated into less-specific prefixes, which makes the
	  routing subsystem more efficient by decreasing overhead.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Space networks provide a unique opportunity to provide
	  extremely efficient routing by assigning a unique prefix or
	  block of addresses per celestial body and its proximal
	  orbits. Management of the IP address space is currently
	  documented in <xref target="RFC7020"/>, but this only covers
	  continental regions and does not provide for addressing for
	  space.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Address space for outer space should be managed by a single
	  Regional Internet Registry (RIR) and blocks of address space
	  should be allocated for each celestial body of
	  interest. Space service providers should use prefixes
	  assigned by this RIR.

        <t>UDP <xref target="RFC768"/> has no notion of time and,

      <section anchor="quic-section">
        <name>QUIC</name>
        <t>QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/> like most IP transport protocols
	implements congestion control mechanisms, which, based on
	various metrics such as calculated delays or packet loss, pace
	the rate of sending packets at the source node to decrease the
	perceived congestion in the network. QUIC supports many new
	features suitable and useful in deep space such as 1 RTT for
	connection establishment and security, mobility, 0 RTT,
	streams, user space, etc. [TLI: This sentence needs more words
	to explain these references.]</t>
        <t>Current implementations of QUIC typically set various
	transport configuration parameters suitable for the Internet
	environment, expecting an RTT to be in the hundreds of milliseconds
	and a normally always-connected network. Therefore, QUIC
	stacks using default configurations will not work in deep
	space. However, studies and simulations <xref
	target="quic-sim"/> showed that with proper configuration of
	parameters, QUIC stacks can support the delays and disruptions
	in deep space. <xref
	target="I-D.many-deepspace-quic-profile"/> describes how to
	properly configure a QUIC stack for deep space applications,
	where QUIC is unaware of disruptions. If the transport is
	aware of the disruptions, further optimizations are possible.</t>
        <t>Having multiple streams and applications within a single

      <name>HTTP</name>
      <t>HTTP by itself has no notion of time. An HTTP request and
      response may take minutes or hours to be completed. However,
      current infrastructure and software on the Internet have various time-related configurations that will not work well in the deep space context.</t>
      <t>HTTP headers containing time, such as Cache-Control and
      Expires <xref target="RFC9111"/>, should not be used or if used,
      must be set to large enough values to cover the longest delay so
      that expiration does not happen before the actual data arrives
      at the destination. As with any HTTP application and content on
      the Internet, these headers should be set properly based on the
      deployment use case, which is even more important for deep
      space. Similarly, when continuous content transfer is used, as
      with 100-Continue <xref target="RFC9110"/>, proper values for
      headers should be set.</t>
      <t>HTTP clients and servers typically have default timeouts that
      should be modified. For example, curl <xref
      target="curl"/> has the "-m" option for this use
      case. Similarly, HTTP server implementations have various
      timeout configuration variables that must be set
      properly. Testing with HTTP client Curl and HTTP server nginx
      and an introduced network delay of 20 minutes showed that HTTP
      communications work well with basic configuration changes.</t>
      <t>HTTP applications themselves must be developed using an asynchronous pattern and if they have timeouts, they should be adjusted appropriately.</t>
      <t>Internet websites are designed with the assumption of
      hundreds of milliseconds delay and relatively always connected,
      where pages contain multiple queries to get further resources,
      media, queries to web services, and downloading additional code
      and frameworks. This could work in theory in space, but it will
      not be optimal, as multiple queries will be generated and
      therefore take multiple RTT before the whole page is received
      complete. This issue can be mitigated by using various
      techniques such as Web Assembly <xref target="wasm"/> or
      pre-caching. Moreover, it could be possible to have simple HTML
      pages with no or very few references and no media content 
      that was not locally cached. An example would be a rover on Mars presenting an HTTP server with a base and bare HTML page to offer basic info on its status (maybe all in text) and some additional detailed pages, most likely also in base HTML text. However, it is foreseen that most applications based on QUIC-HTTP transport in deep space would be using REST or similar asynchronous patterns and not typical web browsing.</t>
      <t>Caching should be used extensively on space networks to maximize local fetching. Preemptive caching by pre-populating caches with data that shall be used locally on the celestial body network shall be done as much as possible to provide better response time on the local celestial body network.</t>
      <t>QPACK <xref target="RFC9204"/> should be considered for higher bandwidth efficiency.</t>

        <t>
	  For small-scale deployments, one can use IP addresses
	  directly or a mapping from a name to an IP address such as
	  /etc/hosts.  However, this does not provide easy dynamic
	  updates, scaling by hierarchy, service discovery,
	  authentication of records, etc. Therefore, the Domain Name
	  System (DNS) shall be considered early on in the space
	  deployment. However, naming hierarchy and infrastructure
	  must be carefully designed to avoid name resolution over
	  deep space links, given that answers may come after minutes
	  or hours. There are clear advantages of having the space
	  name hierarchy anchored to the current Internet root, as it
	  enables DNSSEC through the same security infrastructure
	  currently used and deployed. Using the same root also does
	  not require new policies. A new TLD or a new root is way
	  more complicated and does not bring any significant value
	  compared to using the current domain tree.</t>
        <t>Care must be taken to manage key lifecycles and resource
	record lifetimes. <xref
	target="I-D.many-dnsop-dns-isolated-networks"/> discusses the
	various methods and the naming hierarchy that should be used in space.</t>

        <t>NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref

	values to avoid timeouts and appropriate transport. NETCONF
	over QUIC transport <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-over-quic"/> or RESTCONF over HTTP over QUIC transport shall be configured with appropriate QUIC transport parameters as discussed in <xref target="quic-section"/>.</t>
        <t>While being declared historic in IETF, SNMP<xref target="RFC1157"/> runs over UDP and has no notion of time. Therefore, with proper configuration of client timeout, it can be used as is to manage nodes and services in deep space.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Using the current IP protocol stack in deep space inherits
      all the work on privacy, cryptography, key management,
      firewalls, and scrutiny of protocols that are deployed on the
      Internet. As an example, TLS has been more carefully examined
      than almost any other secure transport protocol. Moreover, given
      that no changes are made in the protocols, this architecture
      does not bring new security issues. Deep space security
      requirements are different than on the existing Internet, but nothing has been found to prevent the conformance of the IP protocol stack to those requirements.</t>
      <t>As it is currently planned, the deep space network shall be
      isolated from the current Internet by an "air gap", to disable
      any direct communications from the Internet to deep space. Moreover, destination IP prefix filtering shall be used to restrict the traffic to only the relevant one for each link. Note that this shall also be implemented in the routing control plane, but additional security might be appropriate to further protect the deep space links.</t>
      <t>Each celestial network edge device shall have firewall rules
      to prevent inappropriate traffic from entering deep space
      links. If communications from Mars may only occur to Earth, but
      not to the Moon, then appropriate filtering based on destination
      IP prefixes shall be used.</t>
